.sp
This file must have an \fB\&.ini\fP\-like file syntax and can contain the
sections described below, note that their capitalization does not matter.
.sp
It must be located in the directory specified using the parameter
\fB\-\-with\-cfg\fP during the build phase.
This directory is \fB/etc\fP by default..
.sp
It must belong to \fBroot\fP:\fBroot\fP and have \fB0600\fP permissions.
.SH [DIRECTORIES] SECTION
.sp
This  section must contain the following properties:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fIData\fP
.sp
must contain a list of directories in which \fBsys\fP will search
for \fIdata\fP files.
.sp
Each value in this list will be examined in order and must be separated by
a space or a comma.
.sp
Example:
.INDENT 2.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
Data=/opt/etc/sys /etc/sys
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.IP \(bu 2
\fILogs\fP
.sp
must contain the directory where the log files will be put.
.sp
Example:
.INDENT 2.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
Logs=/var/log/sys
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.IP \(bu 2
\fICache\fP
.sp
must contain an existing directory which will host the sys cache.
This directory does not need to be secured because the cache will
only be readable and writable by the root user and will be rebuilt if
deleted or modified.
.sp
When not present this setting defaults to \fB/etc\fP\&.
.sp
Example:
.INDENT 2.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
Cache=/var/cache
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.IP \(bu 2
\fIPlugins\fP
.sp
must contain the directory where the plugins will be looked for.
This directory must belong to \fBroot\fP:\fBroot\fP and have a mode set to
\fB0700\fP\&.
It will be created if it does not already exists.
.sp
The default value for this setting is \fB/etc/sys_plugins\fP\&.
.sp
Example:
.INDENT 2.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
Plugins=/etc/sys/plugins
.ft P
.fi

.SH [MISCELLANEOUS] SECTION
.sp
In this section the following properties are understood:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fIInitial environment\fP
.sp
Its value (if present) must be either a file containing a list of
environment variables definitions (one per line) or an executable
which objective is to generate a a set of line containing environment
variables in the form \fBvariable=content\fP\&.
These variables will overload the existing environ variable if any.
.sp
The executable form of this file must be owned by root to be run.
.sp
These variables can be altered again by using the \fIenvironment\fP
parameter in rules.
.IP \(bu 2
\fIDefault paths\fP
.sp
When no path are given, neither using the \fIpaths\fP parameter, nor using
a full path in the \fIcmd\fP parameter in the rule, then a default list
of paths is used.
Normally this list is read using the \fB_SC_PATH\fP system configuration
variable it it exists or defaults to \fI/bin\(ga\fP and \fI/usr/bin\(ga\fP\&.
.sp
This list will be completed by the space or comma\-separated path list
specified in this parameter.
.IP \(bu 2
\fIMaximum external commands\fP
.sp
This number, which defaults to \fB8\fP, sets the maximum number of
special rule to be attempted when the given tag in not found in the
